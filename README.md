Helicobacter pylori chronically infects the stomach of approximately half of the worldâ€™s population. Manifestation of clinical symptoms associated with H. pylori infection, including cancer, is driven by both strain properties and host responses; and as chronic infection persists, both are subject to change. Studies of within-host bacterial genetic variation, have used comparative sequence analysis to show diversification of infecting populations over time. To characterize how within-host diversity contributes to phenotypes related to pathogenesis, this project leverages a collection of 39 clinical isolates acquired from a single subject at two different time points and multiple gastric niches. During the six years separating collection of these isolates, this individual progressed from a duodenal ulcer, likely with excess acid secretion, to gastric atrophy and an associated loss of acid secretion. Whole genome sequence analysis of these isolates identified 2232 unique single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across isolates revealing genetically distinct sub-groups and a nucleotide substation rate of 1.3x10-4 substitutions/site/year. Gene ontology analysis showed significant enrichment for cell envelope genes among the genes with SNPs. Isolate sub-groups have phenotypic differences in bacterial morphology, induction of inflammatory cytokines, and mouse colonization. Higher inflammatory cytokine induction in all recent isolates maps to shared polymorphisms in the Cag PAI protein CagY while straight morphology in a subgroup of recent isolates mapped to eight mutations in three distinct known helical cell shape determining (csd) genes. The presence of sub-groups with unique genetic and phenotypic properties suggest complex selective forces and multiple sub-niches within the stomach during chronic infection.
