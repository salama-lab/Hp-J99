# Abstract

<em>Helicobacter pylori</em> chronically infects the stomach of approximately half of the worldâ€™s population. Manifestation of clinical symptoms associated with <em>H. pylori</em> infection, including cancer, is driven by strain properties and host responses; and as chronic infection persists, both are subject to change. Previous studies have documented frequent and extensive within-host bacterial genetic variation. To characterize how within-host diversity contributes to phenotypes related to <em>H. pylori</em> pathogenesis, this project leverages a collection of 39 clinical isolates acquired from a single subject at two time points and multiple gastric locations. During the six years separating collection of these isolates, this individual progressed from a duodenal ulcer, likely with excess acid secretion, to gastric atrophy and an associated loss of acid secretion. Whole genome sequence analysis identified 2,232 unique single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across isolates and a nucleotide substitution rate of 1.3x10-4 substitutions/site/year. Gene ontology analysis showed cell envelope genes among the genes with excess accumulation of nonsynonymous SNPs (nSNPs). An isolate dendrogram based on genetic similarity, clusters isolates from each time point separately. Within time points, there is segregation of subgroups with phenotypic differences in bacterial morphology, induction of inflammatory cytokines, and mouse colonization. Higher inflammatory cytokine induction in recent isolates maps to shared polymorphisms in the Cag PAI protein, CagY, while rod morphology in a subgroup of recent isolates mapped to eight mutations in three distinct helical cell shape determining (csd) genes. The presence of subgroups with unique genetic and phenotypic properties suggest complex selective forces and multiple sub-niches within the stomach during chronic infection.
